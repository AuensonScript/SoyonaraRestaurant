# 🍣 Soyonara Sushi Restaurant 🍣

## Description

A landing page for an imaginary Sushi Restaurant named Soyonara (Soysayce + Sayonara) located somewhere in Berlin, Germany. This is a non-existent restaurant that I created for learning purposes.

The page contains following sections:

- Navigation
- Hero Image
- Deals of the week
- Menu of the restaurant (pdf preview)
- Book a table (with a showing form when clicking on the button)
- About us
- Contact
- Footer (with links to the sources of images and link to the author's profile)
